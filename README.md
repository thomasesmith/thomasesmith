### By day I develop and maintain *web applications* for a large and unwieldy global conglomerate. By night, I... well... I do pretty much the exact same thing at night.

<img src="http://itsmetomsmith.com/egolf/egolf-svg.php" align="right" /> I've been a professional web developer for 19 years, a hacker since my family got our first 386 computer, and forever curious. 

#### Languages and Tools That I Use Pretty Much Every Day...
- PHP OOP 
- MySQL & MariaDB / MS SQL
- Javascript & jQuery
- HTML & CSS / Bootstrap
- Git / PHPUnit / REST
- Linux CLI / Apache & Nginx Configuration

#### Stuff I've Been Tinkering With Lately...
- Vue.js
- Arduino & electronic circuits
- C
- Building a 6502 computer from parts
